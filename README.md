# Code for Drone:bit Drone in Manual Mode
To use the Drone:bit in manual mode, you will need a second microbit to act as the drone controller. 
To use manual mode, load this code to the drone and the code from [https://github.com/Microbit-Education/manual-controller](https://github.com/Microbit-Education/manual-controller) to the second microbit being used as a controller.

## Drone Controls
* Button A+B &rarr; takeoff / land (displays “T” for takeoff and “L” for land on LEDs) 
* Button A &rarr; increase altitude by 45cm (displays “U” on LEDs)
* Button B &rarr; lower altitude by 45cm (displays “D” on LEDs)
* Tilt down (pitch) &rarr; move forward by 45cm (displays "&uarr;" on LEDs) 
* Tilt up (pitch) &rarr; move backward by 45cm (displays "&darr;" on LEDs) 
* Tilt left (roll) &rarr; move left by 45cm (displays "&larr;" on LEDs)
* Tilt right (roll) &rarr; move right by 45cm (displays "&rarr;" on LEDs)

*Note: If microbit is tilted in more than one direction, it will move in the direction of greatest tilt.*

## Bugs and Improvements 
* If you send a command and then put it back to neutral, it keeps sending the last command in a loop. Fix to hover once controller is in neutral position. 
* Test different distances (right now at 45 cm = 1.5 ft)
* Find way to increase speed
